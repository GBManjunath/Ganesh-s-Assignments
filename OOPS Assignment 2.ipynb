    "A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.

    "A parameterless constructor is a constructor that takes no parameters. It is defined without any additional parameters inside the __init__ method.\n",

    "A parameterized constructor, on the other hand, takes one or more parameters in addition to the usual self parameter. These parameters are used to initialize the attributes of the object based on the values provided during object creation.\n",

    "   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. It helps in hiding the internal details of an object and allows controlled access to its attributes and methods. Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that promotes data abstraction, information hiding, and code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Describe the key principles of encapsulation, including access control and data hiding.\n",
    "   - Access control ensures that the internal details of a class are not directly accessible from outside. Data hiding involves restricting access to certain details of an object and exposing only what is necessary for the functioning of the class. These principles contribute to the encapsulation of data and behavior within a class.\n",
    "\n",
