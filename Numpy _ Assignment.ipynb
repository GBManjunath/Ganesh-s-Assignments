    "#Numpy Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. What is a Python library? Why do we use Python libraries?\n",
    "# A Python library is a collection of modules and functions that provide pre-written code to perform specific tasks. \n",
    "# Libraries enhance functionality and enable efficient development by providing ready-made solutions for common tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What is the difference between a Numpy array and a List?\n",
    "# Numpy arrays and lists in Python differ in terms of functionality and performance. \n",
    "# Numpy arrays are homogeneous, allowing efficient numerical operations, while lists can store elements of different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Find the shape, size, and dimension of the following array?\n",
    "# Given array:\n",
    "# [[1, 2, 3, 4],\n",
    "#  [5, 6, 7, 8],\n",
    "#  [9, 10, 11, 12]]\n",
    "# Shape: (3, 4)\n",
    "# Size: 12\n",
    "# Dimension: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Write Python code to access the first row of the following array?\n",
    "# Given array:\n",
    "# [[1, 2, 3, 4],\n",
    "#  [5, 6, 7, 8],\n",
    "#  [9, 10, 11, 12]]\n",
    "# Python code:\n",
    "# first_row = array[0]\n",
    "# print(first_row)\n",
    "# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. How do you access the element at the third row and fourth column from the given numpy array?\n",
    "# Given numpy array:\n",
    "# [[1, 2, 3, 4],\n",
    "#  [5, 6, 7, 8],\n",
    "#  [9, 10, 11, 12]]\n",
    "# Python code:\n",
    "# element = array[2, 3]\n",
    "# print(element)\n",
    "# Output: 12\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Write code to extract all odd-indexed elements from the given numpy array?\n",
    "# Given numpy array:\n",
    "# [[1, 2, 3, 4],\n",
    "#  [5, 6, 7, 8],\n",
    "#  [9, 10, 11, 12]]\n",
    "# Python code:\n",
    "# odd_indexed_elements = array[:, 1::2]\n",
    "# print(odd_indexed_elements)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# [[ 2  4]\n",
    "#  [ 6  8]\n",
    "#  [10 12]]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. How can you generate a random 3x3 matrix with values between 0 and 1?\n",
    "# Python code:\n",
    "# import numpy as np\n",
    "# random_matrix = np.random.rand(3, 3)\n",
    "# print(random_matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. Describe the difference between np.random.rand and np.random.randn?\n",
    "# np.random.rand generates random values from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1,\n",
    "# while np.random.randn generates random values from a standard normal distribution (mean=0, std=1).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. Write code to increase the dimension of the following array?\n",
    "# Given array:\n",
    "# [[1, 2, 3, 4],\n",
    "#  [5, 6, 7, 8],\n",
    "#  [9, 10, 11, 12]]\n",
    "# Python code:\n",
    "# expanded_array = np.expand_dims(array, axis=1)\n",
    "# print(expanded_array)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. How to transpose the following array in NumPy?\n",
    "# Given array:\n",
    "# [[1, 2, 3, 4],\n",
    "#  [5, 6, 7, 8],\n",
    "#  [9, 10, 11, 12]]\n",
    "# Python code:\n",
    "# transposed_array = np.transpose(array)\n",
    "# print(transposed_array)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. Perform the following operations using Python on matrices A2 and B2:\n",
    "#    - Addition, Matrix multiplication, Subtract matrix B from A, Divide Matrix B by A.\n",
    "#    - Please clarify the operation symbols used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. Which function in Numpy can be used to swap the byte order of an array?\n",
    "# The function is np.ndarray.byteswap().\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13. What is the significance of the np.linalg.inv function?\n",
    "# np.linalg.inv calculates the inverse of a square matrix, significant in linear algebra for solving systems of linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14. What does the np.reshape function do, and how is it used?\n",
    "# np.reshape changes the shape of an array without changing its data. It takes the original array and a new shape as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15. What is broadcasting in Numpy?\n",
    "# Broadcasting is a feature in NumPy that allows arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes.\n",
    "# NumPy automatically broadcasts the smaller array to the shape of the larger one, making element-wise operations possible.\n",
